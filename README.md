# Two-Port Dynamic Stiffness Model for Flexure Displacement Amplifier

This project will implement the general two-port dynamic stiffness model for three bridge-type flexure displacement amplifiers (Rhombic, Parallel, Aligned) as described in *Ling (2019)*.

I selected Mojo for education purposes, to get some idea about the language and its ecosystem.
